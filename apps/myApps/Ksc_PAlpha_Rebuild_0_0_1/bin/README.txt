KALEIDOSCOPE
Beta v.April_22_2013

Diego Garcia, Toni Pizza, & Aaron Freedman

---ABOUT----------------------------------
You are the captain of an ill-fated space vessel. Your crew is stranded throughout the cosmos, alone and helpless. Help them out of their loneliness by gathering them and allowing them to perish with their comrades.

You'll move to a new sector once you save all the astronauts in your current sector.

--CONTROLS--------------------------------
Left/Right : Rotate or Move
Up/Space : On planet: hold to charge jump; release to jump. In space: jetpack
X : release following crew members
Z : (Press if crew pickup doesn't work)

Shift + R : suicide

---BETA NOTES-----------------------------
Known bugs:
	Screen flashes between menu & game screen.
	Crew collection can break after release (temporary fix by pressing Z).
	
Things we haven't done yet:
	You'll have to manage your save-data on your own right now. You can reset all data by removing the .sav files in the levels/saves folder.
	We don't have a sector transition screen yet. Transitions may be a bit jarring.

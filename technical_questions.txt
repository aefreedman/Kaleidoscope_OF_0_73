Should the level editor and the main game be seperate programs?
If the level editor is part of the main program, how will we:
	Handle the main menu?
	How does the game begin?
	Handle level files?
	Handle saves?
If the level editor is not part of the main program how will we:
	Import/export level files to the main program?
